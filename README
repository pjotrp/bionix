This is a collection of BioLib (http://biolib.open-bio.org/) packages.

Nix is a purely functional package manager. It allows multiple versions of a
package to be installed side-by-side, ensures that dependency specifications
are complete, supports atomic upgrades and rollbacks, allows non-root users to
install software, and has many other features. For more information see
http://nixos.org/.
