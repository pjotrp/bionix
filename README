This is a collection of BioLib (http://biolib.open-bio.org/) packages.

These packages are for binary and source deployment of bioinformatics software
across various Linux distributions (both 32- and 64-bits).

Nix is a purely functional package manager. It allows multiple versions of a
package to be installed side-by-side, ensures that dependency specifications
are complete, supports atomic upgrades and rollbacks, allows non-root users to
install software, and has many other features. For more information see
http://nixos.org/. Copies of these packages can be found in the Nix package
repositories.
